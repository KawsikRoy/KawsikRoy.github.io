NARRATOR #1:  The Adventures of Martin Luther,... an exciting and controversial examination of the Protestant reformer whose re-assessment of the role of the individual in Christian belief shook the foundations of a post-feudal Germany in the grip of the sixteenth century. It was a day much like any other in the quiet little town of Wittenberg. Mamie Meyer was preparing fat for the evening meal when the full force of the Reformation struck.

**HYMIE MEYER:**  
Mamie! Martin Luther's out!

**MAMIE MEYER:**  
Ohh! Martin Luther! Mmh.

**HYMIE:**  
Huhh.

**MAMIE:**  
Did you get the suet, Hymie?

**HYMIE:**  
Oy veh! The suet I clean forgot. Look out; here he comes!

**MAMIE:**  
Girls! Girls!

**HYMIE:**  
Mmhm...

**MAMIE:**  
Your father forgot the suet!

**AUDREY MEYER:**  
Ooohhhh.

**MYRTLE MEYER:**  
Ohh.

**HYMIE:**  
Hello, Martin.

**MARTIN LUTHER:**  
H-- How-- Where's the john?

**HYMIE:**  
Uh, we don't have one.

**AUDREY and MYRTLE:**  
_[giggling]_

**MARTIN:**  
Hhh! Do you need any cleaning inside?

**HYMIE:**  
Oh, no. Today it's all going fine.

**MARTIN:**  
Ahhh. Oh, well, uh, how's about showing me the cutlery?

**HYMIE:**  
Martin, I got a woman and children in there.

**MARTIN:**  
So! There's no problem. I just look at a few spoons, uh--

**HYMIE:**  
Well, I got two girls in there, Martin. You know what I mean.

**MARTIN:**  
Honest! I don't look at your girls. I-- I don't think about them. There!  
_[pat]_  
I put them out of my mind. Their arms, their necks, their little legs and bosoms, I wipe from my mind!

**HYMIE:**  
You just want to see the spoons?

**MARTIN:**  
My life! That's what I want to see!

**HYMIE:**  
I know I'm going to regret this.

**AUDREY:**  
Mhhm.

**MAMIE:**  
Shh!

**HYMIE:**  
Mamie! Guess who's come to see us?

**MAMIE:**  
Hymie! Are you out of your mind, already?! You know how old your daughters are!

**HYMIE:**  
He-- He only wants to see the spoons!

**MAMIE:**  
Well-- Well, what do you have to bring him into my house for?

**HYMIE:**  
Mamie, he doesn't think about girls any more.

**MARTIN:**  
Uh, Mrs. Meyer, as far as girls is concerned, I shot my wad.

**MAMIE:**  
You shot your wad?

**MARTIN:**  
Definitely!

**MAMIE:**  
Which spoons do you want to view?

**MARTIN:**  
Oh, I guess the soup spoons.

**MAMIE:**  
Now they're good spoons!

**MARTIN:**  
You got 'em arranged?

**MAMIE:**  
No, but I could arrange them for you.

**MARTIN:**  
Oh, don't put yourself to no bother, Mrs. Meyer.

**MAMIE:**  
It's no bother. I want for you to see these spoons like I would want to see them myself.

**MARTIN:**  
Aww, you're too kind, Mrs. Meyer. You could get your, eh, daughters to show me them.  
_[bang]_

**MAMIE:**  
Hymie! Get him out of here!

**HYMIE:**  
Mamie! Mamie! He only said for Audrey and Myrtle to show him the spoons.

**MAMIE:**  
Like you think I'm running some kind of bordello here?!

**MARTIN:**  
Mrs. Meyer, how can you say such a thing?

**MAMIE:**  
Listen, Martin Luther! I know what you want to do with my girls.

**MARTIN:**  
Show me the spoons, ehh?

**MAMIE:**  
You want for them to pull up their skirts...

**AUDREY and MYRTLE:**  
_[giggling]_

**MAMIE:**  
...and then lean over a chair with their legs apart.

**HYMIE:**  
Mamie, don't get excited.

**MAMIE:**  
I'm getting excited?! It's him that's getting excited!

**MARTIN:**  
My mind is on the spoons!

**MAMIE:**  
But you can't stop thinking of those little girls over the chairs!

**HYMIE:**  
Oh, oh, I got to go to the bathroom.

**MAMIE:**  
Hymie, I'm a married woman!

**HYMIE:**  
So! Just show him the spoons!

**MAMIE:**  
And you don't want to put nothing up me?

**MARTIN:**  
Mrs. Meyer, you read my mind.  
_[chorus singing 'Hallelujah']_

**NARRATOR:**  
Yes, another convert for the Protestants. But despite Luther's efforts to promote the idea of sex for pleasure, children multiplied everywhere.
